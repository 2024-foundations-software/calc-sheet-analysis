Welcome to ACME software.  We are happy to have you on board here at our start up.  

#### Onboarding

Your first assignment (should you choose to accept it) is to pick up a project that Bilbo Baggins was working on when he left the company.   He said he had some sort of important quest or something.  

Anyhow.  What was Bilbo Baggins working on?

### The demonstratable Spreadsheet.

We are building a spreadsheet that will be used by teachers in primary school and early high school to explain how a spreadhsheet works with a simple interface.   This will be the focus of your employment here at ACME Software.

#### The problem we have.

Bilbo was well on his way to getting the work done however he ended up with some code that kinda works.


Bilbo did a couple of things on his way out.   He deleted the core calculator in `FormulaEvaluator.ts`  

He was also required to provide a message when the user was not logged in to the main page.  

He did do us a favor and he left us the unit tests for `FormulaEvaluator.ts` You can find these unit tests in `FormulaEvaluator.test.ts`.  But we are not completely sure that he did not add something there to confuse the people who are replacing him.

### How the current version works 
short description here and demo in class.

    <td>
    Code Review
    </td>
    <td>
    You have reviewed the code of one of your team mates and have included your report in `CodeReview.md`
    </td>
    <td>

    </td>
</tr>

### Implementation strategy
1. implement the calculator functionality first.  get that working 
1. implement the missing login functionality
1. help your team mates if needed
1. do the code review at any point (its better if you do it when the code is not finished)

At the end of this  assignment you should be able to have separate tabs on your browser with different users using the same spread sheet.
